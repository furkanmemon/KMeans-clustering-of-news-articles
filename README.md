"All the news" dataset from kaggle is used. It is a big dataset which is why can't be uploaded.

The 3 files o the the dataset are stored as "articles1.csv","articles2.csv" and "articles3.csv".

Only articles1.csv is used here due to some memory and system issues.

a tf-idf matrix is first generated.

The tf-idf vectorizer is used in the kmeans model.
